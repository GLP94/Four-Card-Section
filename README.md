# Four Card Section

This is another challenge from the site Frontendmentor. I choose this one simply because I saw an opportunity to use the grid box, something that I've learned of recently. Setting up the grid box wasn't so bad, also through the media query too, to adapt it from a three column setting, to just one. It took me much longer to finish this project because I couldn't decide how to adapt this document to different sizes, and the SVG was a pain to work with.

In the end, I liked how it turned out, but I stil need to work one the various tools for responsive design.

## Tools used

1. HTML
2. CSS
